# Welcome to my Portfolio Website

On my site you will get to know a little bit more about me along with my projects that I have worked on

# A few of the projects:

Hundehutte Mobile App
- an apartment search app that helps dog owners in the Austin, Texas area find an apartment based on their dogâ€™s breed with a focus on restricted dog breeds. With no prior knowledge on app development, completed an Udemy course, researched and became self-taught, and then designed and developed this app independently using Dart, Flutter, Firebase, and Android Studio. Now available on the Apple store.

Yogi Glow Mobile App
- a yoga learning app that helps aspiring yogis learn new poses in a fun way. With the click of a button, Yogi Glow randomly selects a new pose for our users to learn. They will learn about the benefits of each pose, step-by-step instructions, along with detailed information about each pose. I developed this app independently using Dart, Flutter, and Android Studio. Now available on the Apple store.

Figgy Mobile App
- this app is going to be a person financial app where you can track your expenses, set a monthly budget, and monitor your spending each month to track whether you are staying on budget or not. I am currently developing this app with Swift, SwiftUI, and Xcode. I will make this app available on the Apple Store when it is completed. Currently, you can view my Figma file of the wireframe and designs (5 pages long).

CLI Financial Expense Tracker
-  a monthly financial expense tracker that can be run through your terminal and stores your data in a SQL database. If you want to use this for personal use, in order to keep your information private, you will need to create a free account and download the SQL database software onto your computer. Then change the username and password on the code. I hope you enjoy! Please reach out if you need assistance. I developed this program independently with this intentions to learn more about Python, Tkinter interface package, Matplotlib library, and SQL. The code is available on my GitHub Account.

Farm Food Website
- an e-commerce website for a local farm to sell their products to the community. For the first version, I designed and developed the front-end of the website. The second version will include the functionality of the shopping feature. The code is available on my GitHub Account.
